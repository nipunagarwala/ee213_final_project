# ee213_final_project

In this project for EE213 at Stanford, we are designing and simulating an SRAM circuit to optimize for Delay, Power and Area. 
As of now, we have built a model for the pre-decode and decode of the input addresses. Additionally, we have modeled the Sense Amplifiers needed for sensing the voltage droop in the Bitline. Simulations for the same will be done shortly, followed by optimizations.
